1.18.25
	-	First journal entry! Hopefully I remember to do this.

1.21.25
	-	I think I'll write about 3005. I have no idea what I'm doing in that class. C++ is difficult.

1.26.25
	-	Finally figured out how to do flask without a virtual environment. Moving up in the world!

2.3.25
	-	I guess I'll talk about work I have nothing else to talk about. Getting some more hours finally.
		I asked for 10 hours a week and they're giving me half that, so whatever.

2.11.25
	-	Haven't made an entry in a minute oops! I'm starting to figure out C++ and Makefile finally.
		My exam went good I got a 90, but I made a silly mistake so I feel dumb for that.

2.17.25
	-	Finally getting the hang of C++, the assignments are coming easier and easier, although a lot of things
		are still confusing like virtual and shared_ptr and stuff.

2.24.25
	-	Killed my algorithms midterm but forgot to submit the take-home part oops!

3.19.25
	-	C++ exam was easy. Learned from my mistakes last time.
	
3.26.25
	-	Getting the hang of software development. Getting the jobs I need to work on done.

4.4.25
	-	Flight was delayed for forever and I got back to my dorm at like 1 am the night before my algorithms midterm
		but it doesn't matter because I killed it anyway.

4.8.25
	-	Revving up for finals! I've pulled off miracles before I can do it again.
